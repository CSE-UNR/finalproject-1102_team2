Data
Image - 2D array of int
User Choice- int
Image File pointers
Image Rows and Columns - int
Brightness - int
Choice - int

Functionality:
A user is given 4 choices concerning an image. User chooses an option. Image can be
loaded from a file then displayed, a default image can be displayed, an image can be
edited and the image will be saved and displayed. Repeat until the user exits the menu.
The last image displayed is saved.

Functions:
main() Arrays for image, files containing images
Data: Arrays for image, files containing images, variable for brightness
Functionality: Load the menu, In a loop ask player questions regarding choices for an
image, display the choices, repeat until the user exits. Save the final image

menu() Ayla
Input parameters: None
Returned Output: None
Functionality: Display the options of load new image, display current image, edit
current image and exit program, gets user choice.

GetImage() Tyler 
Input parameters: File pointer, int rows, int columns, char image 2D array
Returned Output: None
Functionality: Read the contents of a file provided to get an image.

EditMenu() Ayla
Input parameters: None
Returned Output: None
Functionality: Display the options of crop, dim, brighten or rotate image, get the user
choice

DisplayImage() Tyler 
Input parameters: File pointer, int rows, int columns, char image 2D array
Returned Output: None
Functionality: Display the current image into a 2D array

CropImage() Ayla
Input parameters: File pointer, int rows, int columns, char image 2D array
Returned Output: address of 2D array
Functionality: takes a section of 2D array and allows for user input to create and edited
image, display changes

DimImage() Tyler
Input parameters: File pointer, int rows, int columns, char image 2D array
Returned Output: address of 2D array
Functionality: takes the image and makes each pixel in the 2D array decrease by one
value making it “dimmer”, display changes

BrightenImage() Tyler
Input parameters: File pointer, int rows, int columns, char image 2D array
Returned Output: address of 2D array
Functionality: takes the image and makes each pixel in the 2D array increase by one
value making it “brighter”, display changes

RotateImage() Ayla
Input parameters: File pointer, int rows, int columns, char image 2D array
Returned Output: address of 2D array
Functionality: takes the image and changes the location of each pixel in the 2D array
by 90 degrees, display changes
